**Luma Discord Handler**

This discord handler is using the database system of [Luma-Db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/luma-db)

How to start the bot ?

Go in `config.js` and change the `token`, the `owners` array.
In `database` change the `name` and `password`. The `name` **need to be unique !**

After that do `npm i` and start the bot with `node .`

In this handler you can use `print('your message')` to replace `console.log('your message')`
